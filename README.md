## Description
This project will generate simple SVG files. You have the option to input a 3 character string, a color, and a shape (Square, Triangle, or Circle). It will then generate a file named logo.svg that you can that use.  

## Installation
You will need the dependecies Inquirer and Jest (for the unit tests), but you can simply clone the repository, run npm install, and run 'node index.js' from there the command prompt will run 

## Usage
After running 'node index.js' it will ask the user a few inquirer prompts about the color of the background shape, the shape that you want, and the character string to be displayed. After following the inquirer prompts that file should be generated in the main directory for the user to copy/move as needed
